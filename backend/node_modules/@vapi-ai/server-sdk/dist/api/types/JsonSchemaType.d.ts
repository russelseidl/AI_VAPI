/**
 * This is the type of output you'd like.
 *
 * `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean` are the primitive types and should be obvious.
 *
 * `array` and `object` are more interesting and quite powerful. They allow you to define nested structures.
 *
 * For `array`, you can define the schema of the items in the array using the `items` property.
 *
 * For `object`, you can define the properties of the object using the `properties` property.
